**Hi I'm Moritz ðŸ‘‹.** I study [business informatics at KIT](https://www.wirtschaftsinformatik.kit.edu/bachelor.php) with a focus on machine learning and statistics. I am particularly interested in the mechanics and statistical properties of ML algorithms. Working on data science projects and applying the knowledge of varius ML algorithms is my passion.
